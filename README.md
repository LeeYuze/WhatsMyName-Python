# [WhatsMyName](https://github.com/WebBreacher/WhatsMyName) Python Script V1.3 🔍
Hey there! I’m a regular contributor to Project [WhatsMyName](https://www.whatsmyname.cc), and I built this **unofficial** Python script for one simple reason: quick, reliable checks to see if sites are working. It’s a handy, ready‑to‑use tool I genuinely enjoyed creating.

This script is **not** part of the official WhatsMyName project.

The code is scanned with **Security Bandit** and formatted with **Black** to keep it clean, safe, and PEP8‑friendly.

Feel free to use it—this is open source and made to be shared! 🎉

# Support ♡
There’s no support button here because WhatsMyName isn’t my project. This is my **personal script**, so all support should go to Project [WhatsMyName](https://github.com/WebBreacher/WhatsMyName) and to [@WebBreacher](https://ko-fi.com/WebBreacher). **Please do not donate to me.**

```
python3 whatsmyname.py -c
```

```

- Scan the full list for a **single target username**:

```
python3 whatsmyname.py -u secretmonkey -s ebay

# Latest Improvements 🚀

- Links are now clickable (May 2024). Special thanks to [boringthegod](https://github.com/boringthegod) for the request and idea.
- Scans are much faster (May 2024) while staying accurate. (It’s still smart to compare with WhatsMyName Web just to be safe.)
- **HTML Report Generation** (May 2024): you now get a .html report after each scan with all links in one place.
